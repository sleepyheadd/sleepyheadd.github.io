      <p>In the future, this website will act as a hub for a plethra of creations. The plan is to have a link to Web-based games and art that I've created.</p>
      <p>As for now, this will remain a space for me to better understand how owning and operating a website works, as well as give me a creative foundation to build abstract nonsense upon.</p>
      <p>I don't have any web games to link to as of yet, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conscious_inkwell/">my art stuff can be found here</a> for whatever that's worth.</p>
